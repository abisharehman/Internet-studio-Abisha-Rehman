	<h2><span style="color: grey;">White Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: grey;">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>During the conversation we realized that the White Hat represents a focus on facts, data, and objective information. When someone is "wearing the White Hat," they are encouraged to think neutrally and analytically, setting aside opinions, emotions, or judgments.</p>
		<h3><span style="color: grey;">thoughts</span></h3>
			<p>This will help me approch the final with facts, especially in meetings or reports. This way I am aware of everything that I am showing is based of facts to make it more of a reliable source.</p>
<br>

	<h2><span style="color: #b50000">Red Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: #b50000">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>We learned that the Red Hat represents emotions, feelings, and intuition. When using Red Hat thinking, people are encouraged to express their gut reactions and emotional responses without needing to justify them or provide evidence.</p>
		<h3><span style="color: #b50000">Thoughts</span></h3>
			<p>I want to now onsider instincts and impressions to whoever views my final. This will allow me to consider what others may think of what I create. </p>
<br>
	<h2><span style="color: #000000">Black Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: #000000">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>The conversation under the Black Hat was on how the Black Hat represents caution, critical judgment, and risk assessment.</p>
		<h3><span style="color: #000000">thoughts</span></h3>
			<p> With the black hat I know now that I need to evaluate risks, obstacles, and what might go wrong.</p>
<br>
	<h2><span style="color: #e7d400">Yellow Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: #e7d400">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>With the Yellow Hat we learned that Yellow Hat represents optimism, benefits, and positive thinking. It focuses on the value and potential of an idea, asking questions like: What are the strengths? How could this succeed? What are the benefits if it works?.</p>
		<h3><span style="color: #e7d400">thoughts</span></h3>
			<p>This will let me stay motivated and have a better attitude about what I am creating. </p>
<br>
	<h2><span style="color: #00871d">Green Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: #00871d">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>We talked about how the Green Hat represents creativity, new ideas, and alternative solutions. Itâ€™s about thinking outside the box, exploring possibilities, and encouraging innovation which is something we both can relate too. </p>
		<h3><span style="color: #00871d">thoughts</span></h3>
			<p> I now know to be more creative in what I am creating and try to think out of the box so I can stand out from others. </p>
<br>
	<h2><span style="color: #0009bf">Blue Hat</span></h2>
		<h3><span style="color: #0009bf">conversation</span></h3>
			<p>Blue Hat represents control, organization, and managing the thinking process.So we talked about how this is also valuable to have in getting things done.</p>
		<h3><span style="color: #0009bf">thoughts</span></h3>
			<p>I now know that I need to have more goals on what I am making and showing in my final. I should set more control and organization with lists and managing everything.</p>
