<h1>Movies I like</h1>
<p> The movies I picked for this assignment are because I liked  either the cinematography of the movie was great, or I enjoyed the storyline. There are some movies I like simply because the characters of the movie are interesting. Take King kong for example, King kong had such a humane aspect to him that it made the movie more sentimental. He was not just a monster, but more so an animal who also feels things. Jurassic world also had elements to this with there velociraptor named Blue. He also had care for his trainer and it made the audience have sympathy for the animals. Some movies I added were movies I liked as a kid. </p>
