	<h2> The Domain Name You Like Best and Why</h2>
	<p>The name the I chose for my project will be "Bookishjewels.website", I believe it’s simple, memorable, and not too complicated. When choosing a domain name, I think it’s best to pick something that’s easy to recall and clearly represents the project. When I talked about the other domain name options the group and I decided that the other names most likely had nothing to do with what my final project wanted to be. </p>
