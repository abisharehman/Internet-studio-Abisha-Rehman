	<h1>Dodge ball team</h1>
 <p> My team would be called the going merry based off the boat in one piece. All the memebers I choose for my team are from the show because of their abilites.
	 Each member of this team contain things that would boost eachother to win at the game. Since they are already a team in the show besides one of the characters, 
	 they all can work together to win and that is why I choose them.  </p>
