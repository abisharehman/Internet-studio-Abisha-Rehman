<p>I'd have dinner with Sabrina Carpenter because I've loved her music for as long as I can remember. Her songs have been the soundtrack to so many moments in my life—whether it's the raw honesty in her lyrics or the way she can turn heartbreak into something beautiful. Sitting down with her, even just for a meal, would be a chance to thank her for creating music that’s meant so much to me.</p>

<h1>Selena Gomez</h1>

<p>I’d have dinner with Selena Gomez because I really admire her success beyond the spotlight. She’s built a powerful brand with Rare Beauty, turning it into more than just a makeup line—it’s a movement focused on self-acceptance and mental health. As someone interested in business and how to build something meaningful, I’d love to hear how she balances creativity, leadership, and purpose.</p>


<h1>Tate Mcrae</h1>

<p>I’d have dinner with Tate McRae because I really admire how hard she works. From dancing to songwriting to performing, she puts everything into her craft and it shows. Her dedication and drive at such a young age is incredibly inspiring, and I’d love to hear more about what keeps her motivated and how she pushes through the tough moments.</p>
