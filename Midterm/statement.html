<P> When choosing visuals, size, and color palette. I wanted to choose the colors used for the movie and game because I wanted to show the aesthetic of the movie. I also wanted to choose the best images to use that really showed what I was talking about when referencing scenes from the movie so I used movie clips.  I also wanted the images to not be so big that it would take over the entire screen, because then it would make the whole layout overwhelming.</p>

<P>When it came to fonts I also wanted to use something simple, at first I wondered if I should use video game aesthetic fonts, but I wanted the midterm to be easy to read. I think having a more simple layout when it comes to fonts makes the assignment look clean and more modern, compared to other fonts that can make things chaotic and hard to read.
