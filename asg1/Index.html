	<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
	<p> The material I have learned from my lesson is that the body element usually contains the html for a web page visible content. 
	What I also learned is that the correct syntax for the paragraph html element is p first then p with a slash for the closing tag. </p>

<h2> Semester 2 project </h2>
	<p> I am not so sure what I wanna do yet, but I know if we are making or setting up to make one up. I make bracelets, and maybe I can do something 
		With that were I can advertise it. I craft many things as well in which someday I hope I can sell. I think
		I can do something regarding that for my semester project. </p>
