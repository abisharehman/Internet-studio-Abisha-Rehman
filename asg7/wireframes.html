	<h1>Wireframes</h1>

	<h2>Questions</h2>

	<h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
		<p>Sketching wireframes is fast, flexible, and great for brainstorming, but sketches can be hard to share or edit and may appear unpolished to stakeholders compared to digital wireframes.</p>

	<h3>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>
		<p>For my project, sketching wireframes by hand would work best because it's quick and easy. I can draw out my ideas fast without needing to learn any software. It also helps me focus more on the layout and design without getting distracted by small details. Since I'm still figuring out how I want things to look, sketching lets me change things easily and try different ideas.</p>
