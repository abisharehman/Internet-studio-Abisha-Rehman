	<p>Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson would be a compelling hypothetical presidential candidate due to his universal likability, natural charisma, and strong work ethic. As a former athlete and successful entertainer, he has built a public image grounded in discipline, resilience, and relatability. He’s also expressed genuine interest in public service, which adds a layer of seriousness to the idea. His broad appeal across political lines and his ability to connect with a wide range of Americans could make him a unifying figure in a deeply divided political climate.</p>
