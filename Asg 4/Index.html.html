  <h1>Why I dislike Chappell Roan </h1>
  <p> Chappell Roan is a newer artist who is enjoyed by many just not me. I find her to be over-the-top and her style too much and not relatable. That does not mean she is not a good artist she is just not something I would really enjoy listening to. When I listen to music it is because I find it relatable or enjoyable most of the time and her songs do not have either for me. </p>
